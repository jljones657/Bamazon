# Bamazon

This is an application that lets you purchase items from an Amazon preset list of products in a catalog stored in a mySQL database. The first step is navigating to the folder in terminal, or gitbash where you've downloaded the project, and then entering the command **node bamazonCustomer.js**

You will then choose your desired product by entering it's ID number, which is listed to the left of the item in terminal, or gitbash. After this, you will be asked how many of this product you'd like to purchase.

After entering this command, you will be shown the list of products that are remaining. If the command you entered earlier has no products left you will be told **I'm sorry we don't have that many products in stock.**

Then you will be prompted to make another choice.
